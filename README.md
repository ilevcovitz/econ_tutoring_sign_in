This is a repository for the web-based tutoring sign-in system for the Economics Tutoring center. The software is intended to provide a framework for students to sign in at the tutoring center. Accurate attendance information is necessary in order to research the effectiveness of the tutoring center and learn on ways to improve it. There is additional functionality to allow instructors to view which of their students visited the tutoring center. This allows for instructors to provide incentives if they so choose. The attendance information is additionally displayed in an online ipython notebook which auto-updates daily.

The software runs under a Python Flask framework and mySQL database.
